Magic Squares
=============

Finds magic squares ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square)) of an arbitrary order. Note that this is a brute force way to approach the problem; there are several ways to compute magic squares more effciently.  This algorithm checks every possible permutation of the given order by design.  Also note that this program considers rotations and reflections of the same magic square as unique solutions.

Usage:
	javac MagicSquares.java
	java MagicSquares 3
